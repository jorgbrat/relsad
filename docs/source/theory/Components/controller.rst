Controller
======================

In RELSAD, the power system should be initialized with a main controller. This could either be a manuall controller which repesent a more traditional method of controlling the system where multiple actions are performed manually or it could be a smarter controller with a higher share of automation. 
For each child network in the power system, the main controller will create and allocated a controller for of the  networks. 
The control system is made to simulate a central control strategy similar to a control center at a system operator.
